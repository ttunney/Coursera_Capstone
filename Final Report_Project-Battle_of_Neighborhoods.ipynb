    "This project will attempt to identify which Washington, DC neighborhoods provide the greatest value to Airbnb customers while remaining in close proximity to free attractions, such as parks, monuments, museums, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The actual target location will be the National Mall, which is home to several free attractions, including the Smithsonian museums, Presidential monuments (e.g., George Washington National Monument, Lincoln Monument, etc.), war memorials (e.g., Vietnam, WWII, WWI, Korea), Capitol Building Complex, National Archives, Library of Congress, and much more.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Because of foot traffic, this area can be expensive for merchants and parking is almost non-existent. Great area to be in for a business, but either too expensive or first-come-first served.\n",

In addition, this project aims to illuminate, for potential tourists, where to stay in DC to maximize bang for your buck without compromising proximity to free attractions.\n",

Although I have lived in the D.C. metropolitan area for over 15 years, I hail from Memphis, Tennessee and am very much a southerner who believes in making people feel comfortable and at home.  I take pride in having hosted travelers from Boston, Iowa, California, South Carolina, Australia, the UK, Germany, India, Thailand, South Korea, China, Taiwan, and even more far away places.  I value and am fascinated by the personal and cultural uniqueness of each of my guests.  Because I am a foodie who loves exploring cultures through food, the question I most want to ask each of them is what is your favorite food and why?  Whether they stay 2 nights or 30 nights, the vast majority of our guests have left feeling a deeper connection to the city and to us as a result of their stay with us.   \n",

I have traveled around the world (and still do), and enjoy the possibilities airbnb gives travelers. These days I love traveling both to the tropics and arctic areas of the world.  I attended the first Airbnb Open conference in 2014 from where my photo swinging on Belo was taken!\\r\\n\\r\\nI love Washington, DC, and am happy to share the city with guests.   \n",

Reid, my Canadian husband, and I enjoy sharing our home with people from all over the world. We have our own pet care business, so we might also be hosting a dog or two in our home. Before I started our pet care business, I worked quite a few years in the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Clinton Administration, and then ran a nonprofit organization.  All of it was very challenging and rewarding, but there is a lot more joy in caring for pets!   \n",

This should be sufficient for analysis and eliminate the need to merge to two later. We can also tell that the 'neighbourhoods_cleansed' attribute is better for our purposes than 'host_neighborhood'. This judgement is based on the fact that 'neighbourhoods_cleansed' is a sanitization of the neighborhood data, whereas host_neighborhood is raw input by the host. This results in people listing their building as a neighorhood or their conception of what \"their neighborhood\" is rather than boundaries recognized by the City. \n",

If we were considering, as an investor, where should you buy property to get the best investment? That would be appropriate. Here, the goal is to figure out where you might want to stay in DC, on a budget, to take advantage of free attractions. Like most cities, DC has taxis, uber drivers, metro rail (subway), etc., so getting around isn't difficult. However, from my limited experience, cities are often best explored by foot, not tour buses.\n",

    "    This is the purpose of this project. DC is one of the most expensive places in the United States. Where can you stay that's affordable and be able to walk to things that are free. Eating will still be expensive, so why not save your money elsewhere. Plus, it's the questions people will ask upon learning of your visit. If you visit Paris, the questions are what did you think of the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, Monmatre, Notre Dame, they don't ask or, frankly care, about obscure things with which they can't identify themselves. Reductive social analysis, but true.\n",

Dating back to the colonial period, the neighborhood has kept much of its charm. It's also filled with shops, restaurants, and bars. This neighborhood is also right along the DC waterfront.\n",

Penn Quarter used to be a sleepy area of the town -- for work and not play. It's still a work in progress, but more and more restaurants are coming each week."
